#### Let's Make a Nuclear Bomb!!!

#### RECEIPT FOR A HOMEMADE HYDROGEN BOMB

#### For starters, you have the two basic ingredients at your house right now. In your sink is water, in your back yard at 12 parts per million is the most common element on earth that is better than uranium, thorium.

#### Making fission part of bomb.
# Step 1. Get thorium from the best natural resources around or buy it from a chemical supply store.

# Step 2. If using natural thorium(meaning you dug it up somewhere). Separate its isotopes from the non-thorium isotopes. Use information from this site or research it. (Basicly you heat it to a vapor and use magnetic or laser seperation). There are other ways to seperate it.

# Step 3. Make descision. Can enrich thorium to uranium-233 or use fusion-fission device listed at this site. If enriching it you will only need conventional explosives to set it off.

# Step 4. Make decision - Can buy lithium-6-deterium hydride compound from a chemical supply house instead of making it. If making it follow directions below.

# Step 5. Get water from sink. Make hydrogen from it with electrolysis. Distill this hydrogen to deuterium. Distilling diagrams listed at this site as well as electrolysis diagrams.

# Step 6. Make decision. Can distill tritium from hydrogen or make it with focus fusion reactor.

# Step 7. If using focus fusion reactor choice can make lithium-6 or tritium directly. With direct tritium no sparkplug will be needed in nuclear device. diagram of focus fusion reactor listed on this site.

# Step 8. Can make lithium, tritium, deuterium, thorium, uranium-233 into a compound powder if want. see compound section of this site for that.

Step 9 From above decisions construct nuclear device. if using natural thorium construct fusion-fission device. Will need to decide what to use for a spark plug. Plain liquid or solid hydrogen might be ok. If using lithium6-deuterium construct fusion device but we will not need plasma because the fission device will set it off but we will still need a sparkplug. See fission and fusion devices for more information. If using uranium-233 only need explosives to set it off. If using tritium-deuterium just put it beside the fission device it will go off on its own when the fission device explodes. No sparkplug will be needed with tritium-deterium device just a fission device.
